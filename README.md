> You learn new stuff every day.  These are the things that I learned, so maybe I can pass them along to you.

I'm still amazed by the fact that pretty much every day that I work I can still learn something new, even if I'm only programming for a short period of time, or doing something relatively boring.

Much of the time, the things that I learn are just secondary knowledge that I get from some blog post, but there are still plenty of new ideas that pop up just by fiddling around and trying to get something working or trying to see why another thing works the way it does.  The occasional inspiration comes after I've spent FAR too long trying to understand why this "clearly correct code" is failing in a completely unobvious way.  Let's try to keep those to a minimum.
